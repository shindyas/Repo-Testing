At this test for the first time I try to learn and use the tools Robotframework, so I need to set up the configuration. In addition, at an early time I considered using data driven for multiple data, but I ran out of time. I'm eager to improve my knowledge over time, if you are willing to give me the chance.

Hope my submission close enough to pass the test.


Thank you.
