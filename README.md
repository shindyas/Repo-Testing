---Claim---
For the first time I try to learn and use the tools, so need to setting up the configuration.
In additonal, at early time I consider to use data driven for multiple data, but I run of time. I'm eager to improve my knowledge during time, if you willing to give me the chance.

Hope my submission close enough to pass the test.


Thank you.
